# Go Wild with Angular
This is the Repository for the Wild Hacks Meetup on 5/17/2017.  For the moment it is just a placeholder.

# pre-reqs
In order for the tutorial to work, please install the following:

## Nodejs
NodeJS provides a batch javascript runtime and a set of tools for managing packages (libraries) in javascript.   NodeJS can be downloaded at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).   Download vertion 6.1 or better.

after installing you should be able to type the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v

```

## Git, Github, and a github account
You should have a working version of git with the ability to connect to github.com.  The easist way to do that, is to simply install the software at [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).  After installation, you should be able to go to the command line and type:
```
git --Version
```
And have it display a version number (mine is 2.10.1.windows.1)



This should display the versions of the node engine (>6.1) and the package manager NPM (~4.1)

## The angular cli.   
The information on the angular cli can be found on [cli.angular.io](https://cli.angular.io).  To install after installing nodejs:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli -g
```

Verify that the cli is correctly installed by typing:

```bash
ng --version
```

your output should look something like:

```
