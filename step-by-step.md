# Step 0 to 1
Step one adds [boostrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) to the project for better styling.  It does this by modifying the `.angular-cli.json` file and adding to the styles array.   
## 1a Install Boostrap
`npm install bootstrap --save`

## 1b Modify `.angular-cli.json`
open `.angular-cli.json` and modify the `assets` array.

The Fragment of the file is as follows:
````
    "styles": [
        "styles.css",
        "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      ],
````

insure ng serve is not running.  if so, stop it and restart after saving the file.

`ng serve` and you should get 'app-works' but in a slightly different font.

# Step 1 to 2: create two way binding on an edit field
Open the file `app.component.ts` in the \src\app folder.

change the value of title from app works! to what you would like to use.

just below the `title` assignment in the class, initialize a new variable to hold the artist.  

we're going to create a button bound to a function that takes a string (an artist name) to add to an array of artists we will display, and reset the edit file.   Within the component should be the following fragment to do those tasks:

````
  title = 'Favorite Musicians';
  artist = '';
  addArtist(toadd:string) {
      this.artists.push(toadd);
      this.artist='';
  }
````

now open the file `app.component.html` to present the view for this information.

Below the `<h1>` with the title; add a new `<div>` with an  `<input>` tag.   us the NgModel to double bind to the artist property of your class: `[(ngModel)]="artist"`

After the input tag, add a button.  style the button with the bootstrap 'btn' class.   Bind to an event using angular's () operator to a mouse click to call the `addArtists` method with the currently entered text as an argument. 

Bind to `artist` and `artists` to display their values using double curly braces `{{}}`.  use the `json` pipe(`|`) to expand the array.   The html file will look like the following
````
<h1>
  {{title}}
  </h1>
<div>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Artist Name" [(ngModel)]="artist">
  <button class="btn" (click)="addArtist(artist)">Add Artist</button>
</div>

<p>{{artist}}</p>
<p>{{artists | json}}</p>
````
## Step 2 to 3: ngFor
We now want to display our artists in a bulleted format.  This introduces us to the structural template directive in angular, `ngFor`.

open `app.component.html`.

Delete the two paragraphs that output artist and artists.  replace them with an ngFor loop.  

we are also going to add some basic styling.  Let's put our title in a `<div>` with wildcat colors.  Additionally, let's use some default bootstrap styles to add to our text info and button to size more nicely and adopt the bootstrap look.

We will create the wildcat-colors style in `app.component.css`
app.component.html should look like this:
````
<div class="wildcat-colors">
 <h1>
  {{title}}
  </h1>
</div>
<div class="form-group">
  <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-8 col-4">
      <input type="text" class="form-control " placeholder="Artist Name" [(ngModel)]="artist">
  </div>
  <button class="btn" (click)="addArtist(artist)">Add Artist</button>
</div>

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let a of artists">{{a}}</li>
</ul>

and `app.component.css` should look like this:
````
.wildcat-colors {
    background-color: #4E2A84;
    color: #d8d6d6;
}
# Step 3 to 4:  refactor and create a stylish artist list component with favorites

## Create an Artist class with a name and favorite property
We can use the angular cli to create a typescript class file to hold the Artist object.   Create it with a name string property and a favorite boolean property:

1.  generate the class with the angular cli:
`ng g class Artist`
this will create artist.ts in the src\app directory.

open the file and create this class:
````
 export class Artist {
    public favorite = false;
    constructor(public name: string) { }
}
````

2. now create the new component, `app-artist-list` by executing the following command:
`ng g component artistList`
3. make sure the component activates appropriately.  put the tag `<app-artist-list></app-artist-list>` in `app.component.html`.  
When this is served, you should see artist list works! in the browser.
4. change app.component to create a list of artist objects with a favorite property.  change the method properties as below in app.component.ts:
````
artists: Artist[] = [];

  addArtist(toadd: string) {
      this.artists.push(new Artist(toadd));
      this.artist = '';
  }
  ````
5. change the reference to app-artist-list to pass an input property in `[]` toe the tag:
  `<app-artist-list [artistlist]="artists"></app-artist-list>`
6. add artist list as an input using the @Input decorator.  First, import it from the angular libary.  The first line will read:
`import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';`

also import the artist class:
`import { Artist } from '../artist';`

before the contructor of the class, add the @input decorator and declare `artistlist`:
` @Input() artistlist: Artist[];`
7. finally, in the artistList component (`artist-list.component.ts`) add a method to toggle the favorite flag in the object:
````
 toggleFavorite(favartist: Artist) {
    favartist.favorite = !favartist.favorite;
  }
````
8. now make the view match. Open `artist-list.component.html` We will put the artists and favorites in a `<div>` and `<table>`.  For the favorite column, we will add a button that shows an empty or filled star depending on the disposition of the favorite flag for that artist object.
- create the basic table.  We use some simple bootstrap styles Note: we use `ngFor` again, this time in the table row (`<tr>`) element:
````
<div class="container">
  <table class="table-striped table-bordered">
    <tr>
      <th class="col-md-1 col-sm-1">Fav</th>
      <th class="col-md-6 col-sm-4" >Artist</th>
    </tr>
    <tr *ngFor="let a of artistlist; let i=index">
      <td>
       MyFav
      </td>
      <td >{{a.name}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
````
This should render the artists when adeded using `ng serve`

9. Now we need to toggle the favorite.  in the first table data element, where it now says 'MyFav'  we will put two buttons.  We show the star based on the favorite property.  To do this, we use the `*ngIf= ` structural directive.   When the expression is true, that element is shown (and evaluated if there are methods or properties access within).  A `<span>` is useful to do this.  When the button is clicked, it should call the method we created and toggle the favorite flag.  The button will look like this:
````
  <button (click)="toggleFavorite(a)" class="btn btn-xs artist-fav">
          <span *ngIf="a.favorite" class="glyphicon glyphicon-star" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span *ngIf="!a.favorite" class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
````
We style this button again with wildcat colors.  css styles are local to the component, so create the `artist-fav` style in `artist-list.component.css`:

````
.artist-fav {
    background-color: #4E2A84;
    color: #d8d6d6;
}
````
# 4 to 5 Add an Artist Info Service
In this step we call out to the server to get some additional meta data for each artist so we can show a picture and potentially some other info.   A service provides a way to isolate logic that may be shared across components.  It's a special angular class, that can be 'injected' into components to provide new functions.
1.  Use the cli to generate the component `ng g s artistInfo`
by default two files are added in the `app` directory
````
  artist-info.service.spec.ts
  artist-info.service.ts
````
The spec file is a test.  Note that unlike components, just a .ts file is generated (no html or css).  A test is generated (unlike a simple class).  

The format of the service is also different from the class.  In particular, the Angular specific annotation @Injectable is added to the class definition.  This make it so it can be 'injected' into the contstructor of the view.   This more losely bind the UI components to the controller logic in the service; and promotes easier substitution for component reuse and testing.

2.  the CLI does not automatically add the service to our modules and components.  First, declare it in the module file `app.module.ts`.  A synonym for services is `provider`.  Add the `artistInfo` service to the provider, and import the definition from the `.ts` file.  In `app.module.ts` `@Module` should look like this:
````
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    ArtistListComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule
  ],
  providers: [ArtistInfoService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
````
3.  Let's make our service actually do something.  To start, let's just have it return a string.  We're going to want to get a URL to an artist's picture.  Let's just return a fake url based on what's passed.
